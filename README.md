# Customs portal template

The templates in this repository are based on the Material Design for Bootstrap (MDB) framework. This is the Material Design UI element library on top of the standard Bootstrap front end development framework.
More details on MDB here: https://mdbootstrap.github.io/bootstrap-material-design/

The original Material Design framework is available here:
https://material.io/develop


# Getting started
These templates are built on the starter template available in MDB here. References to the MDB framework are linked through CDNs, but you may want to change these to locally hosted files.
